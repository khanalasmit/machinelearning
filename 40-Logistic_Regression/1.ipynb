    "- We will predict the model to predict taking the data. Then first we would observe if the data is linearly separable. In the logistic regression we use the genearl equation of the line. $AX+BX+C=0$. To find the line, the objective is to find the value of the A,B,C that make the best fit line. We start with the random value of the number. We need to run a loop we select a random point to identify if the line is best fit(we check the if the line is predicting correctly for the point). If the line is not predicting correctly then the transformation is applied to adjust to the incorrect prediction. Doing this we get the line fitting perfectly. "
