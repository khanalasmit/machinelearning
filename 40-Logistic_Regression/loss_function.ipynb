For a model to predict the green and red. suppose the sigmoid gives 0.7 for one and 0.3 for another that means that first one has the probablity of being green 0.7 and second 0.3. But for the first one the probalbity of being red is 0.3 and for secong one is 0.7. In cross entropy we add the higher probalbity. In the same eg above lets green be one and red be 0. For green one putting in the formula $-1*log(0.7)+(1-1)log(0.3)$ this means that the highere probalbity is added. Similar will happen for the red ball.\n"
