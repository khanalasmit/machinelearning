    "## **Key Differences Between Bagging and Random Forest**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Feature Selection**\n",
    "- **Bagging**: Uses **all features** for each split in every tree\n",
    "- **Random Forest**: Uses **random subset of features** (âˆšp features for classification, p/3 for regression) at each split\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Base Estimator**\n",
    "- **Bagging**: Can use **any base estimator** (Decision Trees, SVM, etc.)\n",
    "- **Random Forest**: **Only uses Decision Trees** as base estimators\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Randomness**\n",
    "- **Bagging**: Randomness only from **bootstrap sampling** of rows\n",
    "- **Random Forest**: **Double randomness** - bootstrap sampling + random feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Overfitting Control**\n",
    "- **Bagging**: Reduces overfitting through **ensemble averaging**\n",
    "- **Random Forest**: **Better overfitting control** due to feature randomness + ensemble\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Tree Depth**\n",
    "- **Bagging**: Trees can be **pruned or controlled depth**\n",
    "- **Random Forest**: Trees are typically grown **deep/unpruned** (high variance, low bias)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Feature Importance**\n",
    "- **Bagging**: Limited feature importance analysis\n",
    "- **Random Forest**: **Built-in feature importance** calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "Random Forest is a **specialized type of bagging** that:\n",
    "- Only uses Decision Trees\n",
    "- Adds feature randomness at each split\n",
    "- Generally performs better than"
